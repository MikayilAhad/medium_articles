Python Meets Pawn: Decoding My Chess Openings with Data Analysis

In this blog, I'll guide you through the process of analyzing your chess games played on the Chess.com platform using Python.
Chess has always been a passion of mine, a beautiful game introduced to me by my father. My early years were spent playing chess with family, which later transitioned to the digital boards of Chess.com. Recently, there's been a resurgence in chess's popularity, fueled by well-known streamers and the educational efforts of Chess Grandmasters. This new wave of interest sparked a question in my mind during a series on chess openings: 'What are the openings I frequently use, and how successful are they for me?' Realizing I had no insight into my own preferences or success rates, I decided to marry two of my greatest loves: Chess and Python.
Let's get started on understanding the steps, learn how to use the Chess.com API, and find out how to check out your own opening moves in Chess! 
P.S. This blog assumes that Python and preferably Jupyter Notebook (or any other IDE) is already installed on your laptop.
